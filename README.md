# Tip Calculator

In order to calculate the tip for your bill, you will need the following information:

1. Your total bill
2. The percent you would like to tip
3. How many people you would like to split the tip with (optional)
  - If you do not wish to split the tip, leave the value at 1

Once you have put in that information, then press **Calculate Tip** to figure out how much you need to tip per table (or per person if the tip is split).
